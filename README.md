- MLRegression : Solving a two-parameters regression problem solved using the Maximum Likelihood estimation and comparing the result to the regression produced by Seaborn
- RandomSampling : Manually sampling data from a Binomial and a Poisson distribution and comparing the result to the expected PDF (Probability Density Function).
- covariance.py : Evaluation of the covariance of a set of data points
- marginal_pdf_ex.py : Representation of the marginal pdf of a given joint probability distribution
