# StatisticalDataAnalysis
 Python scripts for simple statistics functions, written during the course of __Statistical Data Analysis__ by prof. Sioli at the University of Bologna

The folder includes:

- __MLRegression__ : Solving a two-parameters regression problem solved using the Maximum Likelihood estimation and comparing the result to the regression produced by Seaborn
- __RandomSampling__ : Manually sampling data from a Binomial and a Poisson distribution and comparing the result to the expected PDF (Probability Density Function).
- __MarginalPDF__ : Representation of the marginal pdf of a given joint probability distribution
- __covariance.py__ : Evaluation of the covariance of a set of data points
